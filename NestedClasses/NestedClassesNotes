 Two types of Nested Classes
 1. Static Nested Classes
 2. Non-Static Nested Class (a.k.a Inner Classes)
 
 
 A) Static Nested Classes:
 
1. This static nested class can access all the methods and variables of outer class including private 
2. and can only access static variables and methods of outer class
3. By default the methods in Static Nested Class will not become static, when need to make it static explicitly.

* creating object:
		Student c=new College.Student();
		
* Accessing static methods in Nested class:
 		College.Student.msg();
 		
 		

 B) Non-Static Nested Class: (a.k.a Inner Classes)
 
 1. Member Inner Class ----> class created within class and outside method
 
 	creating Objects and accessing it:
 	
		Department department=new Department();
		Department.Student2 s=department. new Student2();
		
 2. Anonymous Inner Class ----> class created for implementing an interface or extending class. 
 								The java compiler decides its name.
 	* only a single object is created
 	* class that has no name is known as an anonymous inner class in Java
 	* Java Anonymous inner class can be created in two ways:
 	
 		1. Class
 		
 			   1. Anonymous class implementation using class
			   2. now compiler creates an anonymous class 
			   3. which implements anonymousClass() method --> which could be overriding or overloading.
			   4. where Department2 class is abstract, implementing abstract anonymousClass() method.
			   
			   Department2 department2=new Department2() {
			   public void anonymousClass() {
				   Student2 s=new Student2();
			   }
		       };
		       
		       5. Calling anonymous class method
		       
		       department2.anonymousClass();	
 		
 		
 		2. Interface		
 			   
 			    1. Anonymous class implementation ---> using Interface
				2. Deps is an interface (in Department2.java file)
				Deps deps=new Deps() {			
				@Override
				public void anonymousClass() {
					System.out.println("\nInterface based Anonymous Class");
					new Student2();
					System.out.println("Interface based Anonymous Class");
					
				}
				};
				
				3. Calling anonymous class method
				deps.anonymousClass();
 								
 								
 3. Local Inner Class ----> A class was created within the method
 				
 				1. Department3 java file
 				2. creating class inside method
 
				public void getStudent() {
				
						System.out.println("Getting Student Class ----> Local Inner Class");
				
						class Student3 {
							public Student3() {
								System.err.println("\n\nDepartment id : " + id);
								System.err.println("Department Name : " + getDeptName());
								System.err.println("Hod  : " + getHodName());
							}
				
							public void msg() {
								System.out.println("Message from Inner Classs-----------------> Local Inner Class");
							}
						}
						// accessing it 
						Student3 s = new Student3();
						s.msg();				
				}
				
				
4. Nested Interface:

		---> Refer to InterfaceNesting.java file
 		---> we can create interface inside class as well as class inside a interface 
 		---> we can also use Nested Interfaces as well
 		---> outer class methods are not available for nested interface
